# ♦ Explain the essence of computational problem solving
# > The art of solving problems by creating *Representation* that captures all
# > all the releavant aspects of the problem and an algorithm that solves the
# > problem by the use of the *Representation*

# ♦ Explain what a computer algorithm is
# > A set of an instructions used to solve problem. But there are different
# > levels of algorithms, ideally you want an algorithms that that correctly
# > solves a problem in a reasonable amount of time or othewise it is of
# > limited used in practical use.
