# ♦ Explain the essence of computational problem solving
# > The art of solving problems by creating *Representation* that captures all
# > all the releavant aspects of the problem and an algorithm that solves the
# > problem by the use of the *Representation*

# ♦ Explain what a computer algorithm is
# > A set of an instructions used to solve problem or goal. But there are different
# > levels of algorithms, ideally you want an algorithms that correctly
# > solves a problem in a reasonable amount of time or othewise it is of
# > limited used in practical use.

# ♦ Explain the fundamental components of digital hardware
# > CPU - The processing unit for a computer
# > RAM - The memory of a computer where executed programs reside
# > Motherboard - Buses that transfer data between the CPU and Memory
# > Storage - HDD, SSD, USB-Stick

# ♦ Explain the role of binary representation in digital computing
# > Numbers can be defined in any radix base. We usually use base 10 numbers
# > which are numbers from 0..9 but a binary reprentation uses a radix base of 2
# > which consists of 0 and 1. Example => base10 - 99 || base2 - 01100011

# ♦ Explain what an operating systems is
# > Software that has the job of managing the hardware resources of a given
# > computer and providing a particular user interface

# ♦ Explain the fundamental concepts of computer software
# > The goal is to create a program that will solve a given problem
# > Before a program is written, a design for the program must be developed. And before a design can be developed,
# > the problem to be solved must be well understood. Once written, the program must be thoroughly tested.

# > The main fundemantal concepts are broken into 4 steps:
# > Understand the problem
# > Describe and design the problem
# > Implement your design in code
# > Test your code.

# ♦ Explain the fundamental features of IDLE in Python
# > Bundled set of software tools for program development.
